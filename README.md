## Next Word Prediction

This project focuses on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict the next word in a given text sequence. By training a model on a large corpus of text, the model learns patterns and relationships between words to predict the most likely next word in a sentence or text sequence.

### Approach:
- **Data Preparation**: The dataset consists of a large text corpus that is tokenized into words and sequences.
- **Model**: A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used to train the model. The network learns to understand the context of previous words to make predictions about the next word in a sequence.
- **Framework**: TensorFlow and Keras are used to build, train, and evaluate the model.

### Results:
The model can predict the next word in a sentence with a high degree of accuracy based on the context provided by the previous words.

### Technologies Used:
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, NumPy, Pandas  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook
